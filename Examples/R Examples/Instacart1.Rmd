## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(methods)

ordr_pr <- read_csv("../../Data/all/order_products__prior.csv")
prods <- read_csv("../../Data/all/products.csv")
```

### Data Preparation

```{r, message=FALSE}
# get the shopping baskets
order_baskets <- ordr_pr %>% 
  inner_join(prods, by="product_id") %>% 
  group_by(order_id) %>%
  summarise(basket = as.vector(list(product_name)))

# compute transactions
transactions <- as(order_baskets$basket, "transactions")
```

### Analyzing the baskets

Let's first do some groundwork and analyse the basket sizes

```{r}
hist(size(transactions), breaks = 0:150, xaxt="n", ylim=c(0,250000), 
     main = "Number of Items per basket", xlab = "#Items")
axis(1, at=seq(0,160,by=10), cex.axis=0.8)
mtext(paste("Total:", length(transactions), "baskets,", sum(size(transactions)), "items"))
```


Next, let's determine which items are frequent. We set the support threshold to 
0.02, that means an item will be considered as frequent iff at least 2 percent 
of all the baskets contain it. So in our case, an item will be considered as being 
frequent if it is contained in more than 64,000 baskets.

```{r, fig.height=8}
item_frequencies <- itemFrequency(transactions, type="a")
support <- 0.02
freq_items <- sort(item_frequencies, decreasing = F)
freq_items <- freq_items[freq_items>support*length(transactions)]

par(mar=c(2,10,2,2)); options(scipen=5)
barplot(freq_items, horiz=T, las=1, main="Frequent Items", cex.names=.8, xlim=c(0,500000))
mtext(paste("support:",support), padj = .8)
abline(v=support*length(transactions), col="red")
```


The ranking shows lots of fruits and vegetables - especially bananas, avocados, 
strawberries and lemons. But there is also milk and hummus (mmmh..)! We can also 
see that there are some similar products like avocado and hass avocado or 
strawberries and organic strawberries that we may want to group together. 

### Frequent Itemsets

Now, lets compute the frequent itemsets. We decrease the support threshold to 
take into account the small probability of observing a frequent itemset of at 
least size 2. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
support <- 0.008
itemsets <- apriori(transactions, parameter = list(target = "frequent itemsets", supp=support, minlen=2), control = list(verbose = FALSE))

par(mar=c(5,18,2,2)+.1)
sets_order_supp <- DATAFRAME(sort(itemsets, by="support", decreasing = F))
barplot(sets_order_supp$support, names.arg=sets_order_supp$items, xlim=c(0,0.02), horiz = T, las = 2, cex.names = .8, main = "Frequent Itemsets")
mtext(paste("support:",support), padj = .8)
```


First of all, with a support threshold of 0.008 (~25k baskets), we observe frequent pairs only, 
and secondly: there are lots of bananas! Each of the eight pairs with highest support contains bananas. 
Nearly all of the items are either fruits or vegetables. There is just one 
frequent pair that contains milk (of course, with bananas). An interesting 
combination is bananas and baby spinach - maybe a tasty smoothie?

### Association Rules

Lets mine some association rules: First, we use a low support threshold and a 
high confidence to generate strong rules even for items that are less frequent

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rules1 <- apriori(transactions, parameter = list(supp = 0.00001, conf = 0.6, maxlen=3), control = list(verbose = FALSE)) 
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
summary(quality(rules1))
plot(rules1)
```

There are some rules with a heavy lift indicating a strong association between the items. Let's 
further investigate those critical rules

```{r}
inspect(sort(rules1, by="lift")[1:10])
inspect(sort(rules1, by="confidence")[1:10])
```

Seems like those rules mostly affect similar items which were usually bought together. 
Notice that there are no rules containing bananas.

Next, we increase the support and decrease confidence to get rules of some more frequent items but 
with less confidence. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rules2 <- apriori(transactions, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.4, maxlen=3), control = list(verbose = FALSE)) 
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
summary(quality(rules2))
plot(rules2)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
inspect(sort(rules2, by="lift")[1:10])
inspect(sort(rules2, by="confidence")[1:10])
```

Now we see some yogurts, fruits and drinks which were often bought together. 

Finally, lets further increase support and decrease confidence

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rules3 <- apriori(transactions, parameter = list(supp = 0.005, conf = 0.1, maxlen=3), control = list(verbose = FALSE)) 
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
summary(quality(rules3))
plot(rules3)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
inspect(sort(rules3, by="lift")[1:10])
inspect(sort(rules3, by="confidence")[1:10])
```

And again, lots of (organic) fruits and vegetables. 

**Thank you and stay tuned for further improvements ;-)**
